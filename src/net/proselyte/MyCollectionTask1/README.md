## GENERAL USAGE NOTES

This Program has two java-files. Runner.java is main. You can test all capabilities
from ChangebleArray.java.
ChangebleArray.java implements int type object collection. This collection has functions
such as:
* getValue(): > Searching element by index.
* getIndex(): > Searching index by value.
* add(): > Adding element to end of list, and changing all previous element like that: arr[i] = arr[i] + integer
* remove(): > Removing element by index and changing all other element like that : arr[i] = arr[i] - integer
* minValue(): > Searching min value in list
* maxValue(): > Searching max value in list
* getAverage(): > Return average of list
* getArray(): > Return array

How we can see, this collection allows to change other elements in array, when elements depend from new element
